# CMS-FRONTEND

Backend Repository: https://github.com/mahalyka/insignia-cms-backend.git

Requirement: 
- Node.js 16+
- React v18
- Mui v5
- React Router v6

Challenge skipped:
1. Too many scope of the system. This is required all around of system, e.g. Authentication services, etc.
2. Media management, not based on Strapi based practice. It's kinda weird, and I skipped that as well.
3. There's two kind of FE, and I need a scope actually. We can make the system that I want, but I need the exact requirement actually. I skipped that thing as well.
